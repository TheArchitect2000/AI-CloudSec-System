# üåê CloudSec-AI-Lab  
*A collaborative learning project to build a cloud-based security system with AI, Snowflake, and AWS.*  

## üìñ Overview  
This repository is a **student-led lab project** under the supervision of **Dr. Reza Ramezan**.  
Our goal is to design and implement a **cloud-based security platform** that integrates:  
- AI models for **spam detection** and **threat detection**  
- **Honeypots** for intrusion research  
- **Firewalls, IDS, and IPS** for network security  
- **Cloud monitoring tools** (AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Snowflake analytics)  
- **Threat modeling frameworks** like **STRIDE, DREAD, and MITRE ATT&CK**  

The project combines **theory** (cybersecurity frameworks) and **practice** (cloud engineering + AI).

## üéØ Objectives  
- Learn **cloud-native security practices** (AWS, Snowflake).  
- Practice **AI-based threat detection** (ML models for spam, anomaly detection).  
- Deploy and monitor **honeypots** to study attacks.  
- Implement and configure **firewalls, IDS, IPS**.  
- Apply **threat modeling** frameworks: STRIDE, DREAD, MITRE.  
- Work collaboratively using **GitHub workflows, issues, and pull requests**.
