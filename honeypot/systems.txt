Install:
Cowrie (SSH/Telnet honeypot).
Dionaea (malware capture).
HoneyDB agent (for logging common probes).

Then, Forward logs to CloudWatch or S3 for analysis.

Athena + S3 → Query honeypot logs to find attack patterns.

Thinkst Canary (deception sensors).
Illusive Networks / Attivo (enterprise-grade deception).

Important Considerations
	•	Isolation is critical → Put honeypots in a separate VPC or subnet to avoid risk to production.
	•	Never store sensitive data on honeypots — they are designed to be compromised.
	•	Use monitoring & alerts so you know when someone interacts with it.
